Light Cycle Arena is a two-player game based on the film TRON (1982). 
In the movie, characters battle by riding motorcycle-like vehicles called light cycles that leave impenetrable glowing walls in their paths. 
Hitting any of these walls or the side of the arena means certain death for a rider. We have turned this concept into a video game (like many before us).

In this game, each player controls a moving particle that leaves a deadly trail in its path. 
The most basic game mode is Battle, in which the goal is simply to destroy your opponent before they destroy you. 
The other two game modes are Command Post and King of the Hill. 
The former has the added objective of intercepting ‘command posts’ distributed throughout, 
while the latter rewards the player for occupying a certain area in the center of the arena. 
However, the foremost objective in all game modes is to avoid collision.
